### Repositories Overview

- [igrep/ts-that-grow](https://github.com/igrep/ts-that-grow)
    - 🎄I invented this solution to solve a problem in the no-code app in my job. See [the original article](https://dev.to/igrep/flexiblly-extend-nested-structures-trees-that-grow-in-typescript-4347) or [its Japanese version](https://eng-blog.iij.ad.jp/archives/18900) for details.
- [igrep/svelte-store-tree](https://github.com/igrep/svelte-store-tree)
    - 🌲I created this to manage the state of an AST of the no-code app in my job. It made it a little easier to operate on the nested structure.
        - But *just a little*. I found it has many problems after releaseing. I guess Svelte 5 would deprecate it.
    - See also the introduction articles below
        - [Why I failed to create the "Solid.js's store" for Svelte, and announcing svelte-store-tree v0.3.1](https://dev.to/igrep/why-i-failed-to-create-the-solidjss-store-for-svelte-and-announcing-svelte-store-tree-v031-1am2).
        - (In Japanese) [svelte-store-treeというライブラリーをリリースしました](https://zenn.dev/igrep/articles/2022-09-svelte-store-tree)

- [igrep/vertons](https://github.com/igrep/vertons)
    - 🎮A hobby work to study for creating a no-code app.
    - (In Japanese) See [フロントエンド開発者的週刊アスキーへの道（ならず）](https://zenn.dev/igrep/articles/2022-06-ascii) for details.

#### 📚Related to Programming Languages

- [haskell-jp/makeMistakesToLearnHaskell](https://github.com/haskell-jp/makeMistakesToLearnHaskell)
    - NOTE: 🇯🇵The main contents are in Japanese.
    - An long introduction to Haskell for Japanese beginners.
    - Features:
        - Consists of exercises and explanations of knowledge necessary to do the exercises.
        - In each chapter, the readers learn things *only* necessary to do the exercise.
        - Recommends the readers to learn from error messages.
    - I'm recently less interested in Haskell, but I don't want to give up finishing.
- [custard-lang/custard](https://github.com/custard-lang/custard)
    - Currently developed as a Clojure-like AltJS (language that translated into JavaScript) for me.
    - 🚧Still work in progress.
- [igrep/lean-workshop: SF.lean勉強会でigrepが書いたコードの記録](https://github.com/igrep/lean-workshop)
    - I expected that the skill to use a theorem prover will help me to design/develop the language above in the future. That's why I started to learn Lean every two weeks with my friends.

#### 🍴Forks

- [igrep/brick-break-anywhere](https://github.com/igrep/brick-break-anywhere)
    - Forked to learn how DOM works, as [the original author @canalun told us in JSConfJP 2023](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hjs2J4fScWcs42oJ11F9uv1iuSnb_25TEZxyJo6UlLU/edit#slide=id.g2970b3f929e_0_0).

- [igrep/translated-content: The source repository of all translated content for MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/igrep/translated-content)
